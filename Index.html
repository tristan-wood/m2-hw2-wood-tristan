<h2>My Hobbies</h2>
<p>As someone that usually works 14 hours a day, I have many hobbies. They include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sleeping</li>
    <li>Sleeping while cuddling with my dog</li>
    <li>Sleeping after watching TikTok</li>
    <li>Playing video games sometimes</li>

<p>I hope that was informative!</p>
<h2>Why am I taking this class?</h2>
<p>Besides it being a course requirement, it is vital to develop basic computer skills in the profession I am pursuing.</p>
<p>Technology has evolved the news industry, and many of the old heads in the field have not developed the skills to stay relevant. It is important that I stay on top of my game and not fall behind the curve.</p>
